About
======

Progressius° is a super simple "goal progress" tracker. If you have a goal you want to keep track of, give it a name, any numerical amount and a nice icon. Progressius° uses a browser's localStorage capabilities to save goals on that specific device + browser.

Why?
====

I don't know man! On multiple occassions I've wanted a slick progress tracker for small goals like saving up for some gadget or something. I could technically just keep it mentally, throw it on my "todo" list or use actual paper and pencil but decided to take the opportunity to learn some more JS and HTML5 stuff.

I had some a design and some old yet functional code that I decided to spruce up. Changed my CSS over to SASS, added icon fonts, etc. This is my first "full" web app, I hope you like it!


Planned Future Features
----------------------

- Custom images
- "Amount" labels, i.e. instead of just numbers it could add a word/currency. E.g. 151 pokemons, $2000, 20k donations
- Mobile Friendliness
